## ArXiv Data Classification

This project aims to classify research papers from the ArXiv repository based on their abstracts and titles. The classification is performed using machine learning techniques, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models.

### Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve and preprocess data from the ArXiv repository, including paper abstracts, titles, and subject categories.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the text data for further processing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models, such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
4. **Model Training**: Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including traditional classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers) for text classification.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time prediction and classification of new research papers.
